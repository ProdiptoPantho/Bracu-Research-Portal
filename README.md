Bracu Research Portal


An Introduction to our project
How would it be if there was an interactive research portal for our institution rather than conventional boring Dspace? It would be great right? Our project tends to build an interactive repository for institutions. Here we will be able to verify with our institution emails, connect with other researchers from our institution, help other researchers, share resources, volunteer for projects and know about each other.
